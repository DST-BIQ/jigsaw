DST Team Jigsaw project known issues:

****** Re-submission - 28.5.2018 ***********

Known issue - project does not solve puzzles with over 40 pieces in reasonable time
TODO - fix errors print to fit expected format and order

****** Second submission - 11.5.2018 *************

TODO - fix errors print to fit expected format and order
From Amir's Review:
Done - Packages: no need for two packages (or not clear what is the separation between the two).
Done - Package name - lower case.

Done - main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException
Why main throws these exceptions?

Done - threadsManager = new ThreadsManager(Integer.valueOf(args[3]));
You assume the position of the argument and I think it's not as required.

Done - It is better not to have too much login in Main.
Better to parse the command lune argument and pass them on but keep the task of creating ThreadManager etc. to the PuzzleManager or similar class. Not in main.

Done - public void playPuzzle(ThreadsManager threadsManager) throws IOException, InterruptedException
Why do you let these exceptions get out of the manager?

Done -
That's not the way to wait for ThreadPool to finish:
       while (solution==null && counter<200)
            Thread.sleep(10);
            counter++;
        }


Done - private boolean isSolved = false;
Should probably be AtomicBoolean


Done :As the TODOs say: Puzzle and PuzzleSolver should be refactored.
- write down what are the roles of each one
TODO: - draw sequence diagram for their major methods





****** First submission - 13.4.2018 *************

1. Missing system tests - will be added on next version
2. Validations printing should be improved to suite spec examples (will be validated in system tests)
3. Should create additional validations tests
4. Missing tests for checkSolutionUtility (in Puzzle class)
5. Missing method level documentation - will be added on next version
6. Added improvement of error handling - separating between fatal and non fatal errors - fatal errors, if any - will be printed before non-fatal errors
